Task 9:


Aim: To perform record play back using Selenium IDE Script.
Description:
The entire script creation process can be classified into 3 chunks:
Process 1: Recording – Selenium IDE aids the user to record user interactions with the browser and thus the recorded actions as a whole are termed as Selenium IDE script.
Process 2: Playing back – In this section, we execute the recorded script so as to verify and monitor its stability and success rate.
Process 3: Saving – Once we have recorded a stable script, we may want to save it for future runs and regressions.
